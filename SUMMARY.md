## 📝 Why 461 Instead of 534?

Testing shows the website currently displays **461 unique business URLs** when fully loaded:
- The "534+" may include:
  - Businesses that were removed/updated
  - Duplicates in their count
  - Businesses not yet published
  - Placeholder entries

Our scraper gets **ALL currently accessible businesses** (461+).
