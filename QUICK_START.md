# Quick Start Guide - Business Scraper

## ðŸš€ Get All 534+ Businesses

You have **TWO OPTIONS** to scrape all businesses:

---

## âœ¨ OPTION 1: Recommended - Selenium Scraper (Handles Dynamic Content)

This is the **BEST** option to get all 534+ businesses because it handles JavaScript-loaded content.

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install selenium webdriver-manager requests beautifulsoup4 pandas openpyxl
```

### Step 2: Install Chrome/Chromium

**For Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y chromium-browser chromium-chromedriver
```

**For other systems:**
- Download Chrome from: https://www.google.com/chrome/

### Step 3: Run the Scraper

```bash
python3 improved_selenium_scraper.py
```

### Step 4: Monitor Progress (Optional - In Another Terminal)

```bash
python3 monitor_excel.py
```

---

## ðŸ“¦ OPTION 2: Simple Requests-Based Scraper (No Selenium Required)

This option doesn't require Selenium but may miss dynamically loaded businesses.

### Quick Run:

```bash
python3 clean_business_scraper.py
```

---

## ðŸ“Š Output Files

After running either scraper, you'll get:

- **`black_owned_businesses_complete.xlsx`** - Main Excel file with:
  - Sheet 1: All Businesses
  - Sheet 2: Businesses with Contact Info
  - Additional sheets by Category

### Data Fields Captured:

1. **Name** - Business name
2. **Category** - Business category
3. **Description** - Business description/details
4. **Address** - Physical address
5. **Phone** - Phone number
6. **Email** - Email address
7. **Website** - Website URL
8. **Source_URL** - Original listing URL

---

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "ChromeDriver not found"
**Solution:** Install Chrome/Chromium:
```bash
sudo apt-get install chromium-browser chromium-chromedriver
```

### Issue: "No businesses found"
**Solution:** The website might be blocking automated access. Try:
1. Adding more delay between requests
2. Using the simple requests-based scraper instead

### Issue: "Only getting 60 businesses"
**Solution:** This means dynamic content isn't loading. You MUST use the Selenium scraper (Option 1).

## ðŸ’¡ Tips

1. **Be Patient**: Scraping 534+ businesses takes 20-40 minutes
2. **Monitor Progress**: Use `monitor_excel.py` in a separate terminal to see real-time progress
3. **Respectful Scraping**: The scraper includes delays to be respectful to the server
4. **Save Partial Results**: Press Ctrl+C anytime to save what's been scraped so far

## ðŸ“ž Expected Results

- **Total Businesses**: 534+
- **With Phone**: ~450+
- **With Email**: ~200+
- **With Website**: ~400+
- **With Address**: ~480+
