## 💡 Tips & Tricks

### 1. Save Partial Results
Press **Ctrl+C** anytime to save what's been scraped so far to `black_owned_businesses_partial.xlsx`

### 2. Speed vs Completeness
The scraper waits 0.8 seconds between each business to be respectful to the server. You can edit this in the code if needed.

### 3. Troubleshooting

**Problem: "Only getting 60 businesses"**
- ✅ You're using the new Selenium scraper which fixes this!

**Problem: "Chrome not found"**
```bash
sudo apt-get install chromium-browser chromium-chromedriver
```

**Problem: "Scraper stops or crashes"**
- Check internet connection
- Run again - it will skip already processed businesses
- Check the partial results file
